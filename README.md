# Data Analysis of Distances and Correlations
This repository focuses on the calculation of distances and the analysis of correlations in data sets with AirBnB information, applying numerical and statistical methods to explore and understand the relationships between hosts with the most accommodations in a city and the proximity to certain cultural points within a city.

## Description :memo:
This repository offers scripts and tools to calculate distances within data sets with AirBnB information and the multiple cultural locations, and analyze the correlations between the desired variables.

The codes presented are:

- [Correlations.py](/Correlations.py): Functions to compute the distances and calculate the correlations in a Python Script as a standalone application.
- [Correlations.ipynb](/Correlations.ipynb): Functions to compute the distances and calculate the correlations in a Python Script as an auto explainable Jupyter Notebook.

The correlation file presents the information both numerically and in correlation matrices.
