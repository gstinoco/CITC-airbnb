# Data Analysis of Distances and Correlations
This repository focuses on the calculation of distances and the analysis of correlations in data sets with AirBnB information, applying numerical and statistical methods to explore and understand the relationships between hosts with the most accommodations in a city and the proximity to certain cultural points within a city.

## Description :memo:
This repository offers scripts and tools to calculate distances within data sets with AirBnB information and the multiple cultural locations, and analyze the correlations between the desired variables.

The codes presented are:

- [Distances.py](Distances.py): Script for calculating distances between each AirBnB presented, in the file [host.csv](Information/hosts.tar.gz), and the places stated in the file [places.csv](Information/places.tar.gz).
- [Correlations.ipynb](Correlations.ipynb): Correlation analysis using and auto explainable Jupyter Notebook.

## Requirements :exclamation:

To use the content of this repository, it is recommended to have Python 3.x installed, as well as the libraries necessary to run Jupyter Notebooks and the specific calculations performed in the scripts.


### Library installation

It is possible to install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

    pip install numpy
    pip install pandas
    pip install haversine
    pip install seaborn
    pip install matplotlib

## Researchers :scientist:
The codes and analyzes were developed by a dedicated team, composed of experts in Marketing, statistics, and data analysis.
